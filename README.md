Task 1 (MultiThreading.Task1.100Tasks.csproj):
Open 100Tasks project and write a program that creates an array of 100 Tasks, runs them and waits till all of them are completed. Each Task should iterate from 1 to 1000 and print to the console the following string: “Task #0 – {iteration number}”.

Task 2 (MultiThreading.Task2.Chaining.csproj):
Open Chaining project and write a program that creates a chain of four Tasks:
1st Task creates an array of 10 random integers.
2nd Task multiplies this array with another random integer.
3rd Task sorts this array by ascending.
4th Task calculates the average value.
All these tasks should print the values to console.

Task 3 (MultiThreading.Task3.MatrixMultiplier.csproj, MultiThreading.Task3.MatrixMultiplier.Tests.csproj):
Open MatrixMultiplier project and write a program that multiplies two matrices following the conditions below:
Implement the logic of MatricesMultiplierParallel class using Parallel class. All unit tests within MatrixMultiplier.Tests project should pass successfully.
Create a test inside MatrixMultiplier.Tests project to check which of the multiplier implementations (synchronous or parallel) runs faster. Find out the size that makes parallel multiplication more effective than the regular one.

Task 4 (MultiThreading.Task4.Threads.Join.csproj):
Open Threads.Join project to create a program that recursively creates 10 threads. Each thread should be with the same body and receive a state with an integer number, decrement it, print and pass as a state into the newly created thread. Implement all the following options:
Use Thread class for this task and Join for waiting threads.
Use ThreadPool class for this task and Semaphore for waiting threads.

Task 5 (MultiThreading.Task5.Threads.SharedCollection.csproj):
Open Threads.SharedCollection and write a program that creates two threads and a shared collection:
The 1st task should add 10 elements to the collection
The 2nd task should print all elements in the collection after each adding (in other words, if the collection contains elements from 1 to 10, the second thread should print something like [1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3], …, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], the number of elements should increase).
Use Thread, ThreadPool or Task classes for thread creation and any kind of synchronization constructions.

Task 6 (MultiThreading.Task6.Continuation.csproj):
In the Continuation project you need to create a task which should be attached to the parent with the following continuation criteria:
Continuation task should be executed regardless of the result of the parent task.
Continuation task should be executed when the parent task was completed without success.
Continuation task should be executed when the parent task failed and parent task thread should be reused for continuation
Continuation task should be executed outside of the thread pool when the parent task is cancelled
Demonstrate the work of each case with console utility.


Home task (Optional):
Our task is to create a client and a server for simple enterprise chat.
General requirements: 
Both Client and Server should be implemented as Console or GUI applications (you decide) 
Client and Server interacts with each other using Named Pipes (System.IO.Pipes) or Sockets (System.Net.Sockets) – you decide. For simplicity, connection parameters could be hardcoded. 
Client is a bot which performs the following operations in a loop: 
Connects to the Server with a new name 
Sends several messages to the Server with a short delay between messages. (Messages are retrieved from the list of already predefined messages, the number of messages and delay between messages is random) 
Receives all messages from the Server and displays them on the screen or stores in a text file. 
Disconnects from the Server. 
Repeat the loop until the User stops the Client or exception occurred. 
Server: 
Accepts connections from the Client. On connecting receives the name of the Client.  
Receives messages from the Client and broadcasts them to all other clients connected to this Server . 
Stores a history of N number (defined by you) of messages and sends this collection of messages to the Clients on their initial connection. 
Sends notification to the Clients and safely closes all connections on application close. 

Task 1:
Implement Client and Server using the following approach – one client – one thread. Read and write operations could be synchronous.

Task 2:
Implement Client and Server using one or both approaches:
Classic async operations (BeginXXX/EndXXX) and threads pool for operations
Task Parallel Library

Score board:
0-59% – 5 of 6 required tasks completed and implementation meets all requirements.
60-79% – All 6 required tasks completed, all tests are GREEN and implementation meets all requirements.
80-100% – No major remarks related to clean code principles (SOLID, KISS, DRY, etc.) / Optional task is covered.
